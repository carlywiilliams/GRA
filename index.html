			Classic Tiramisu</h2>
			<p> Layers of delicate espresso-soaked ladyfingers embrace a cloud of velvety mascarpone cream, crowned with a dusting of rich cocoa. Tiramisu is more than dessert—it’s a symphony of coffee, chocolate, and cream that melts in your mouth and lingers in your memory.

				<h3>
				Ingredients </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>1 cup strong coffee (cooled, can also use espresso)
					</li>
					<li>
					3 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional, e.g., Kahlúa or Marsala wine)</li>
					<li>
					3 large egg yolks
					</li>
					<li>
					½ cup sugar
					</li>
					<li>
					1 cup heavy cream
					</li>
					<li>
					1 cup mascarpone cheese (room temp.)
					</li>
					<li>
					1 pack ladyfinger cookies (about 24 of them)
					</li>
					<li>
					Cocoa powder (for dusting)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h3>
				Steps </h3>
				<ol>
				<li>Make the Coffee Mixture: In a shallow bowl, mix the cooled coffee with coffee liqueur (if using). Set aside.
					</li>
					<li>
					Make the Cream Mixture: In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add mascarpone cheese to the yolk mixture, then gently fold in the whipped cream.
					</li>
					<li>
					Assemble the Tiramisu: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee (just 1–2 seconds—don’t soak). Lay them in a single layer at the bottom of a dish. Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers, then spread the rest of the cream on top.
					</li>
					<li>
					Chill: Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight is best).</li>
					<li>
					Serve: Before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder.</li>
				</ol>
